        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Personalised Support:</strong> Get tips and ideas tailored to your doctor's plan for your diet, exercise, and medication routine.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Motivation When You Need It:</strong> Use the special "Keep Going" button. If you're feeling stressed, tempted, or losing motivation, tapping this button will bring up your personal motivational image, a calming video, and a breathing exercise to help you refocus.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Find ideas for healthy recipes or new exercise routines that fit your preferences and fitness level (safely!).</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Connecting Locally:</strong> Discover local gyms, yoga studios, or personal trainers if that's something you're interested in exploring.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Daily Check-in:</strong> We'll ask you each day to quickly rate how you feel you're going with your diet, exercise/wellness routine, and medication (on a scale of 1 to 10). This helps KGC understand how to best support you and keeps your doctor informed of your progress with their care plan (CPDs).</li>
