# User Data Requirements - Healthcare Compliance Guide

## Overview

The Keep Going Care (KGC) healthcare application requires **real human-provided contact information** for all users to maintain healthcare compliance, authentication integrity, and legal standards.

## ✅ **ELIMINATED: Automatic Contact Generation Systems**

### **What Was Removed (July 25, 2025)**

1. **Automatic Phone Number Generation**
   - **Location**: `server/services/tavilyService.ts` (lines 468-477, 621-628)
   - **System**: Mathematical formulas creating fake Australian phone numbers
   - **Pattern**: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 9000)` generating fake area codes and numbers
   - **Impact**: No more generated phone numbers like "02 1234 5678" or "0412 345 678"

2. **Automatic Email Generation** 
   - **System**: Previously generated @keepgoingcare.com addresses
   - **Status**: Completely removed from user creation workflows
   - **Impact**: No more auto-generated emails like "user123@keepgoingcare.com"

3. **Automatic UIN Generation Based on Phone Numbers**
   - **System**: Previously derived UIDs from generated phone data
   - **Status**: Now uses professional healthcare UIN system (KGC-DOC-001, etc.)
   - **Impact**: Professional healthcare-compliant identification system

## ✅ **REQUIRED: Human-Provided Contact Information**

### **Admin User Responsibilities**
When creating **Doctor** accounts, admin must provide:
- ✅ **Real name** (e.g., "Dr. Sarah Johnson")
- ✅ **Real email** (e.g., "sarah.johnson@hospital.com")
- ✅ **Real phone number** (e.g., "+61412345678")
- ✅ **Professional UIN** (auto-assigned: KGC-DOC-001, or manually provided)

### **Doctor User Responsibilities**
When creating **Patient** accounts, doctors must provide:
- ✅ **Real name** (e.g., "John Smith")
- ✅ **Real email** (e.g., "john.smith@gmail.com")
- ✅ **Real phone number** (e.g., "+61433123456")
- ✅ **Professional UIN** (auto-assigned: KGC-PAT-001, or manually provided)

### **Validation Requirements**
- **Email Format**: Standard email validation `user@domain.com`
- **Phone Format**: International format starting with `+` (e.g., `+61412345678`)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: System checks for existing email/phone across all users
- **Real Numbers**: Phone numbers must be capable of receiving SMS authentication

## ✅ **HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE BENEFITS**

### **1. SMS Authentication Integrity**
- Real phone numbers enable authentic SMS delivery
- Patients receive verification codes on their actual devices
- No fake numbers that cannot receive messages

### **2. Emergency Contact Capability**
- Healthcare emergencies require real contact information
- Doctors can reach patients through verified phone/email
- Admin can contact doctors through verified professional channels

### **3. Legal Liability Protection**
- Real contact information meets healthcare data standards
- Audit trails contain authentic user information
- Compliance with TGA Class I SaMD regulations

### **4. Professional Healthcare Standards**
- Doctor-patient relationships require verified contact channels
- Professional UIN system (KGC-DOC-001, KGC-PAT-001) for identification
- Enterprise-ready for large healthcare organizations

## ✅ **VERIFICATION METHODS**

### **Search for Remaining Issues**
```bash
# Check for phone generation (should return empty)
grep -r "Math.random.*phone\|generatePhone" server/ --include="*.ts"

# Check for email generation (should return empty)  
grep -r "generateEmail\|fakeEmail\|auto.*email" server/ --include="*.ts"

# Verify only legitimate email usage remains (for notifications)
grep -r "@keepgoingcare.com" server/ --include="*.ts"
```

### **Expected Results (Post-Cleanup)**
- **Phone Generation**: No results found ✅
- **Email Generation**: No results found ✅
- **@keepgoingcare.com**: Only in notification templates (welcome@keepgoingcare.com) ✅

## ✅ **USER CREATION WORKFLOW**

### **Correct Workflow**
1. **Admin Login** → Create Doctor with real contact info
2. **Doctor Login** → Create Patient with real contact info  
3. **Patient Login** → Receive SMS on real phone number
4. **Authentication** → Email PIN sent to real email address

### **Data Entry Requirements**
- **Name**: Real human names for healthcare identification
- **Email**: Active email addresses for authentication and notifications
- **Phone**: SMS-capable numbers for verification codes
- **UIN**: Professional healthcare identifiers (auto-assigned or manual)

## ✅ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

### **Healthcare Compliance Ready**
- ✅ No automatic contact generation systems remain
- ✅ All contact information requires human input
- ✅ Real phone numbers enable SMS authentication
- ✅ Real email addresses enable PIN delivery
- ✅ Professional UIN system for unlimited scaling
- ✅ Data validation prevents duplicate contacts

### **System Capacity**
- **Before**: 51 users maximum with potential fake contact data
- **After**: Unlimited users with verified real contact information
- **Format**: KGC-ADM-001, KGC-DOC-001, KGC-PAT-001 professional healthcare UIDs

## Summary

The KGC application now requires and validates real human contact information for all users, ensuring healthcare compliance, authentication integrity, and professional standards appropriate for a Class I Software as a Medical Device.
