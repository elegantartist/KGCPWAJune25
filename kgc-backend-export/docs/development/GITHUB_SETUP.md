## üì¶ Size Optimization for GitHub

### Excluded Large Directories
The following directories are excluded from the repository to keep size manageable:

- `attached_assets/` (2.7GB) - User uploaded content and test assets
- `cleanup-backups/` - Temporary backup files
- `cleanup-logs/` - System cleanup logs
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (installed via npm)

### Production Asset Handling
For production deployment, consider:
- Using a CDN for large assets
- Implementing proper file upload storage (AWS S3, etc.)
- Optimizing images before deployment
