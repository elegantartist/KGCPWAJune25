Daily Self-Scores Process Flow
Patient UI Experience
Access Point:

Patient accesses the Daily Self-Scores feature from their dashboard
The interface shows three sliders for Diet, Exercise, and Medication scores
Score Submission UI:

Patient adjusts each slider between 1-10 to report their compliance
Each category has a brief description explaining what the scores mean
A submit button becomes active once all three scores are set
After Submission:

A confirmation animation briefly appears
The ScoreDiscussionDialog appears with Yes/No buttons asking if they want to discuss their scores
If "Yes" is selected, they're directed to the chatbot
If "No" is selected, they return to the dashboard with a success message
Backend Process Flow
Data Capture:

Scores are sent to /api/health-metrics endpoint
Values are validated (1-10 range) before database insertion
Timestamp is recorded with the submission
Database Operations:

New record created in health_metrics table with:
User ID
Three score values
Timestamp
Comments (if provided)
Background Processing:

System records last submission time for alert tracking
Weekly averages are calculated and stored
Progress tracking is updated for badge eligibility
Doctor Notification:

If any score is below 5, an optional alert flag is set
Data becomes available in patient's progress report
Connection to Supervisor Agent
Chatbot Preparation:

If patient chooses to discuss scores, recent metrics are passed to the chatbot
EnhancedSupervisorAgent receives these metrics as parameters
Analysis Flow:

Chatbot examines scores in context of care plan directives
System prepares targeted suggestions based on score values
Lower scores trigger more supportive responses
Response Delivery:

EnhancedSupervisorAgent delivers personalized feedback
Responses reference specific Care Plan Directives
Additional resources or feature recommendations are provided based on scores
That's the current implementation flow for the Daily Self-Scores feature, from UI interaction through backend processing and the optional connection to the EnhancedSupervisorAgent chatbot system.
