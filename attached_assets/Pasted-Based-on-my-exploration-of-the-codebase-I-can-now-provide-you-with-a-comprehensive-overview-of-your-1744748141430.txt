Based on my exploration of the codebase, I can now provide you with a comprehensive overview of your project to share with the agent in your other Repl. Here's a detailed summary of how the application is structured and functions:

Recipe Discovery Platform - Codebase Overview
Architecture
The application is a full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript application with:

Frontend: React (TypeScript) with Wouter for routing
Backend: Express.js server
Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
External APIs: Tavily for recipe search and OpenAI for recipe analysis
Key Components
Backend API Routes (server/routes.ts)
The backend handles several key API endpoints:

/api/search - Searches and analyzes recipes based on user filters
/api/recipes/save - Saves recipes to a user's cookbook
/api/recipes/saved/:userId - Retrieves a user's saved recipes
Authentication routes (/api/login, /api/register, /api/logout, /api/user)
External API Integration
Tavily API (server/services/tavily.ts):
Searches for YouTube cooking videos based on ingredients and cuisine type
Requires TAVILY_API_KEY environment variable
OpenAI API (server/services/openai.ts):
Analyzes and ranks recipes based on health criteria and user preferences
Uses GPT-4o to process recipe data and provide nutritional insights
Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
Database Schema (db/schema.ts)
Two main tables:

users - Stores user credentials
savedRecipes - Stores user's saved recipes with a foreign key relationship to users
Frontend Structure
Pages:
Home.tsx - Main search interface
SavedRecipes.tsx - User's saved recipe collection
AuthPage.tsx - Login/registration page
Key Components:
IngredientForm.tsx - Search form with filtering options
RecipeGrid.tsx - Displays recipe search results
SaveRecipeButton.tsx - Handles saving recipes to a user's cookbook
NavigationBar.tsx - App navigation
UI components from ShadCN (using Tailwind CSS)
Hooks:
useUser.ts - Manages authentication state
useToast.ts - Handles notifications
Data Flow
User enters ingredients and preferences through IngredientForm
Form data is sent to /api/search endpoint
Backend uses Tavily API to find YouTube recipe videos
OpenAI analyzes results and enhances them with nutritional data
Results are returned to frontend and displayed in RecipeGrid
User can save recipes which are stored in the database
Saved recipes can be viewed in the SavedRecipes page
Authentication
Uses Passport.js with a local authentication strategy and session-based auth.
