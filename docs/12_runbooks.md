### Incident Response Workflow

#### Initial Response (0-15 minutes)
1. **Acknowledge Incident**
   ```bash
   # Post in incident channel
   "ðŸš¨ INCIDENT: [P0/P1/P2/P3] - Brief description
   Investigating... ETA: [time]
   IC: @[incident-commander]"
   ```

2. **Assess Impact**
   - Check service status dashboard
   - Review error rates and response times  
   - Identify affected user segments
   - Determine healthcare compliance impact

3. **Immediate Containment**
   ```bash
   # If security incident
   # 1. Isolate affected systems
   # 2. Preserve evidence
   # 3. Change credentials if compromised
   
   # If service degradation
   # 1. Scale up resources
   # 2. Route traffic away from failing components
   # 3. Enable maintenance mode if needed
   ```

#### Investigation Phase (15-60 minutes)
4. **Gather Information**
   ```bash
   # Check application logs
   aws logs tail /aws/apprunner/kgc-api --follow
   
   # Check database performance
   # Monitor connection counts, slow queries
   
   # Check external service status
   curl -f https://status.openai.com/
   curl -f https://status.twilio.com/
   ```

5. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Timeline reconstruction
   - Change correlation analysis
   - Resource utilization review
   - Dependencies status check

#### Resolution Phase
6. **Implement Fix**
   ```bash
   # Emergency hotfix deployment
   ./tools/scripts/deploy_aws.sh
   
   # Database fixes (if needed)
   # Connect to production DB carefully
   
   # Configuration changes
   # Update environment variables or secrets
   ```

7. **Verify Resolution**
   - Run health checks
   - Monitor error rates
   - Test critical user journeys
   - Validate compliance features

#### Communication
8. **Status Updates**
   ```
   Every 30 minutes during active incident:
   "UPDATE: [timestamp] - [current status]
   Actions taken: [brief summary]
   Next update: [time]
   Impact: [user-facing impact]"
   ```

```

### Rotation Procedures

#### JWT Session Secret Rotation
```bash
# 1. Generate new secret
NEW_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)

# 2. Update AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager update-secret \
  --secret-id prod/KGC/sec \
  --secret-string "{\"SESSION_SECRET_NEW\":\"$NEW_SECRET\",...}"

# 3. Deploy with dual-secret support
# Allow both old and new secrets during transition period

# 4. Verify new secret works
curl -X POST https://api.keepgoingcare.com/api/auth/login \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test"}'

# 5. Remove old secret after 24-48 hours
# Update secret to only include new key
```

#### API Key Rotation (External Services)
```bash
# OpenAI API Key Rotation
# 1. Generate new key in OpenAI dashboard
# 2. Update secrets manager
aws secretsmanager update-secret \
  --secret-id prod/KGC/sec \
  --secret-string "{\"OPENAI_API_KEY\":\"sk-proj-NEW_KEY\",...}"

# 3. Deploy application
./tools/scripts/deploy_aws.sh

# 4. Test AI functionality
curl -X POST https://api.keepgoingcare.com/api/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"message":"Hello, test AI functionality"}'

# 5. Revoke old key in OpenAI dashboard
```

#### Database Credentials Rotation
```bash
# For Neon (managed service)
# 1. Create new database user in Neon console
# 2. Generate new connection string
# 3. Update DATABASE_URL in secrets
# 4. Deploy and verify connectivity
# 5. Remove old database user

# For self-managed PostgreSQL
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "CREATE USER kgc_new WITH PASSWORD 'NEW_SECURE_PASSWORD';"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kgc_production TO kgc_new;"
# Update connection string and deploy
# Test functionality, then drop old user
```

### Healthcare Compliance for Key Rotation
- **Audit Logging**: Log all key rotation activities
- **Access Control**: Restrict key rotation to authorized personnel
- **Data Integrity**: Verify no data corruption during rotation
- **Privacy Protection**: Ensure PII encryption keys are rotated securely

## Rate Limit Management

### Rate Limit Configuration

#### API Rate Limits
```typescript
// Current rate limits (adjust based on usage)
const rateLimits = {
  // General API access
  api: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // requests per window per IP
    message: 'Too many requests, please try again later'
  },
  
  // Authentication endpoints
  auth: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
    max: 5, // login attempts per window
    skipSuccessfulRequests: true
  },
  
  // AI chat endpoints
  chat: {
    windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute  
    max: 10, // AI requests per minute per user
    keyGenerator: (req) => req.user?.id || req.ip
  },
  
  // SMS/Email endpoints
  notifications: {
    windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
    max: 5, // SMS/email per hour per user
    keyGenerator: (req) => req.user?.id
  }
};
```

#### External Service Rate Limits
```yaml
OpenAI API:
  - Tier 1: 500 RPM, 30,000 TPM
  - Monitor: track usage via dashboard
  - Alerts: 80% threshold warning
  
Anthropic API:
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: 50 RPM, 40,000 TPM  
  - Monitor: API response headers
  - Backup: fallback to different model
  
Twilio SMS:
  - Default: 100 SMS per second
  - Monitor: webhook delivery reports
  - Alerts: delivery failure rate > 5%
  
SendGrid Email:
  - Free tier: 100 emails/day
  - Monitor: delivery statistics
  - Alerts: bounce rate > 5%
```

### Rate Limit Monitoring

#### Monitoring Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check rate limit status

echo "=== API Rate Limits ==="
curl -s https://api.keepgoingcare.com/api/rate-limit-status | jq .

echo "=== OpenAI Usage ==="
curl -s "https://api.openai.com/v1/usage?date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" | jq .

echo "=== Twilio SMS Usage ==="
curl -s "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Usage/Records.json" \
  -u "$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN" | jq '.usage_records[]'
```

### Rate Limit Incident Response

#### Rate Limit Exceeded
```yaml
Symptoms:
  - 429 "Too Many Requests" errors
  - Users unable to access features
  - AI services returning rate limit errors
  
Immediate Actions:
  1. Identify source of excessive requests
  2. Implement temporary IP blocking if abuse detected
  3. Scale up rate limits if legitimate traffic spike
  4. Communicate with affected users
  
Investigation:
  - Review access logs for patterns
  - Check for bot traffic or abuse
  - Analyze user behavior anomalies
  - Monitor external service quotas
```

#### Healthcare-Specific Considerations
- **Patient Care Impact**: Prioritize healthcare-related API calls
- **Emergency Access**: Maintain higher limits for emergency detection
- **Privacy Protection**: Rate limit doesn't log sensitive request content
