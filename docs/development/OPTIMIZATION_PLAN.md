# KGC Codebase Optimization Plan

## Current Issues Identified
1. **Large Media Files**: Audio tracks and images are causing repository bloat (900MB+)
2. **Code Redundancy**: Similar UI components and patterns repeated across files
3. **Complex Schema**: Many interwoven tables with potential for consolidation
4. **Build Artifacts**: Temporary files and build outputs included in repository

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Repository Structure Reorganization
- Create proper .gitignore to exclude media files, build artifacts, and node_modules
- Move media files to external storage with download instructions
- Implement a CDN strategy for production deployment

### 2. Code Consolidation
- Create shared UI component library for common patterns
- Implement higher-order components for repetitive patterns
- Use composition pattern to reduce duplicate code
- Develop custom hooks for repetitive logic

### 3. Schema Optimization
- Consolidate related tables (e.g., content interactions and preferences)
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Optimize query patterns in database access code

### 4. Loading Strategy Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for large components
- Code-split routes and heavy components
- Optimize image and media loading with proper techniques

### 5. Performance Enhancements
- Memoize expensive computations
- Implement proper React.memo and useMemo usage
- Optimize re-render patterns

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Repository Cleanup
- Implement proper .gitignore
- Remove large files from Git history
- Create streamlined repository structure

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring
- Create shared component library
- Refactor pages to use shared components
- Implement proper composition patterns

### Phase 3: Data Layer Optimization
- Create optimized data access patterns
- Implement caching strategy
- Enhance offline capabilities

### Phase 4: Performance Tuning
- Implement code splitting
- Optimize initial load performance
- Enhance API request batching and caching

## Expected Outcomes
- Repository size reduced from 1.00 GiB to <50MB
- Improved code maintainability through shared patterns
- Enhanced application performance
- Simplified onboarding for new developers
- More robust offline capabilities
