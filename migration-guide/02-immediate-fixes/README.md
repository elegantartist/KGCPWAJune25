# Immediate Fixes

## Overview

Before proceeding with the AWS migration, certain critical issues in the KGC application must be addressed. This section outlines the immediate fixes required to ensure a smooth migration process and prepare the codebase for integration with AWS services.

## Contents

1. [Admin Authentication Fix](./01-admin-authentication-fix.md)
2. [Self-Score Analysis Fix](./02-self-score-analysis-fix.md)
3. [UIN-Based CPD Storage](./03-uin-cpd-storage.md)
4. [Authentication System Preparation](./04-authentication-preparation.md)

## Implementation Approach

The immediate fixes will follow a targeted approach that:

1. Addresses critical functionality issues without introducing major architectural changes
2. Avoids code changes that would conflict with the planned AWS migration
3. Prepares key components for eventual integration with AWS services
4. Ensures the application remains fully functional during the transition

## Execution Plan

Each fix will be implemented with the following steps:

1. Analysis of the specific issue and affected code paths
2. Design of a minimal, targeted fix that addresses the immediate problem
3. Implementation with careful error handling and logging
4. Testing to ensure no regressions or unintended consequences
5. Documentation of changes for reference during later migration phases

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these immediate fixes, the KGC application will have:

1. Functioning admin authentication for patient creation
2. Consistent health score analysis without duplication
3. Regulatory-compliant CPD storage with proper UIN integration
4. Authentication system prepared for eventual Cognito integration

These improvements will provide a stable foundation for the more comprehensive changes required during the AWS migration process.

## Next Steps

After completing these immediate fixes, proceed to the [AWS Setup](../03-aws-setup/README.md) section to begin configuring the AWS environment.
