# Current State Assessment

## Overview

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the current KGC application environment. Understanding the existing architecture, data flow, and security model is essential for planning a successful migration to AWS.

## Key Findings Summary

### Application Architecture

The KGC application currently runs in the Replit environment with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based Progressive Web Application (PWA)
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- **Authentication**: Simple token-based authentication using localStorage
- **AI Components**: Supervisor Agent and specialized sub-agents

The application follows a multi-dashboard architecture (Patient, Doctor, and Admin) with specific features for each user role. The chatbot supervisor functions as the central point of patient interaction, while doctors view dashboards and update Care Plan Directives (CPDs).

### Security Vulnerabilities

Several security vulnerabilities have been identified in the current implementation:

1. **Weak Authentication System**: The current application uses localStorage for authentication tokens, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks.
2. **Missing Access Controls**: Insufficient role-based access control for API endpoints.
3. **Inadequate Data Encryption**: Sensitive health information is not properly encrypted at rest or in transit.
4. **Unstructured Audit Logging**: Limited tracking of user actions and system events.

### Database Structure

The PostgreSQL database contains tables for users, patient health metrics, CPDs, doctor-patient relationships, and system logs. The current schema will require some modification before migration to ensure compatibility with AWS RDS and to implement proper data retention policies.

### Authentication System

The current authentication system relies on simple token-based authentication with manual role checking. This will need to be replaced with a robust AWS Cognito implementation with proper MFA support and role-based access control.

## Next Steps

After reviewing this current state assessment, proceed to the [Immediate Fixes](../02-immediate-fixes/README.md) section to address critical issues before beginning the migration process.
