# Security Vulnerabilities Assessment

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified in the current KGC application that must be addressed during the migration to AWS. Addressing these vulnerabilities is critical to protect sensitive patient health information and comply with APP and TGA regulations.

## Authentication Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insecure Token Storage

**Issue:** The application currently stores authentication tokens in browser localStorage.

**Risk:** 
- Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- Tokens are accessible to any JavaScript running on the page
- No automatic expiration of stored tokens

**Impact:** An attacker who successfully executes malicious JavaScript could steal authentication tokens and impersonate legitimate users, potentially accessing sensitive patient data.

**Example in Current Code:**
```javascript
// From client-side authentication logic
localStorage.setItem('authToken', token);

// Later used in API requests
const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
```

### 2. Weak Authentication Flow

**Issue:** The current authentication system uses simple JWT tokens without proper refresh mechanisms or strict validation.

**Risk:**
- Long-lived tokens increase the window of opportunity for attackers
- Insufficient validation of token claims
- No revocation mechanism for compromised tokens

**Impact:** Once authenticated, a user session remains valid for extended periods, and there's no efficient way to invalidate sessions if a breach is detected.

### 3. Missing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Issue:** The application does not implement MFA for any user role.

**Risk:**
- Single factor authentication is vulnerable to credential stuffing and brute force attacks
- Insufficient protection for privileged accounts (doctors, admins)

**Impact:** Compromised credentials immediately result in unauthorized access to sensitive patient data without additional verification barriers.

## Authorization Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insufficient Role-Based Access Control

**Issue:** Basic role checking exists but lacks granular permissions and thorough enforcement.

**Risk:**
- Potential for privilege escalation
- Inconsistent access control across API endpoints
- Relies on client-side role information stored in localStorage

**Impact:** Users might access functionality or data beyond their assigned role, violating the principle of least privilege.

**Example in Current Code:**
```javascript
// Simplified role check in API endpoint
app.get("/api/admin/patients", async (req, res) => {
  const user = getUserFromToken(req.headers.authorization);
  
  // Basic role check with no additional validation
  if (user.role !== "admin") {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: "Unauthorized" });
  }
  
  // Proceed with admin-only functionality
  // ...
});
```

### 2. Missing Object-Level Authorization

**Issue:** Authorization checks primarily occur at the route level, with insufficient verification that a user can access specific data objects.

**Risk:**
- Potential for horizontal privilege escalation (e.g., a patient accessing another patient's data)
- Doctors might access patients not assigned to them

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to specific patient records could occur even when role-based permissions are enforced.

## Data Protection Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insufficient Data Encryption

**Issue:** Limited encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

**Risk:**
- Sensitive patient health information stored in plaintext in the database
- Reliance on HTTPS without additional encryption layers

**Impact:** In case of database breach or HTTPS downgrade attacks, sensitive patient information could be exposed.

### 2. Inadequate Data Retention Controls

**Issue:** No systematic implementation of the required 7-year data retention policy for medical records.

**Risk:**
- Regulatory non-compliance with APP and TGA requirements
- Lack of automated processes for managing data lifecycle

**Impact:** Failure to maintain medical records for the required period could result in regulatory penalties and compromise patient care continuity.

## Monitoring and Auditing Vulnerabilities

### 1. Limited Audit Logging

**Issue:** Insufficient logging of security-relevant events and user actions.

**Risk:**
- Difficulty detecting suspicious activities or security breaches
- Inability to trace unauthorized access or data modifications
- Limited forensic capability after security incidents

**Impact:** Security incidents might go undetected or be discovered only after significant damage has occurred.

### 2. No Intrusion Detection

**Issue:** Lack of systems to detect and alert on suspicious or malicious activities.

**Risk:**
- Attacks may continue undetected for extended periods
- No automated responses to potential security threats

**Impact:** Prolonged unauthorized access without detection could lead to extensive data breaches.

## Application-Specific Vulnerabilities

### 1. Admin Authentication Failure

**Issue:** The "Admin not found" error prevents proper admin functionality.

**Risk:**
- Inconsistent enforcement of admin privileges
- Unreliable administrative functions

**Impact:** Critical administration functions like user management are unreliable, potentially affecting system security and operations.

### 2. Disabled Service Worker

**Issue:** The PWA Service Worker is disabled, affecting secure offline capabilities.

**Risk:**
- Ad-hoc implementations of offline functionality may not follow security best practices
- Potential for data leakage in offline storage

**Impact:** Compromised offline functionality could lead to insecure data handling or synchronization vulnerabilities.

## Next Steps for Remediation

Based on this security assessment, the following remediation steps are recommended before migration:

1. **Authentication Upgrade:**
   - Replace localStorage token storage with secure, HTTP-only cookies
   - Implement proper token refresh mechanisms with short-lived access tokens
   - Prepare for AWS Cognito integration with MFA support

2. **Authorization Improvements:**
   - Implement consistent server-side role validation
   - Add object-level permission checks for all data access
   - Centralize authorization logic for maintainability

3. **Data Protection:**
   - Implement proper encryption for sensitive data at rest
   - Ensure all API communications use strong TLS encryption
   - Design a compliant data retention system for the 7-year requirement

4. **Monitoring and Auditing:**
   - Implement comprehensive security event logging
   - Prepare logging structure for integration with AWS CloudWatch
   - Define critical security events requiring immediate alerts

These security improvements will be detailed in subsequent sections of this migration guide.
