4. [DNS Cutover Strategy](./04-dns-cutover-strategy.md)

## Overview

The DNS configuration process involves:

1. Managing your domain at Crazy Domains
2. Integrating with AWS Route 53 for DNS management
3. Setting up SSL certificates for secure connections
4. Planning and executing a DNS cutover strategy

## Prerequisites

Before starting the DNS configuration, ensure you have:

- Access to the Crazy Domains account that manages the domain
- AWS account with appropriate permissions for Route 53 and ACM
- All AWS resources (CloudFront, API Gateway, etc.) provisioned and ready

## Timeline

The DNS configuration process should take approximately 1-2 days, accounting for DNS propagation times:

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Crazy Domains Setup | 1 hour |
| Route 53 Integration | 1 hour |
| SSL Certificate Setup | 2-4 hours (includes validation time) |
| DNS Propagation | 24-48 hours |

## Security Considerations

1. **DNS Security**: Enable DNSSEC for added domain security
2. **SSL/TLS**: Implement strong TLS protocols and ciphers
3. **Access Control**: Restrict domain management access to authorized personnel
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for DNS changes and certificate expiration
