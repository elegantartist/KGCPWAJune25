This section provides comprehensive instructions for deploying the frontend of the KGC application to Vercel, a popular platform for hosting static sites and serverless functions.

2. [Project Configuration](./02-project-configuration.md)
3. [Environment Variables](./03-environment-variables.md)
4. [Deployment Process](./04-deployment-process.md)
5. [Domain Configuration](./05-domain-configuration.md)

## Overview

The Vercel deployment process involves:

1. Setting up a Vercel account and connecting it to your repository
2. Configuring the project build settings
3. Setting up environment variables
4. Deploying the frontend application
5. Configuring custom domains and SSL

## Prerequisites

Before starting the Vercel deployment, ensure you have:

- The frontend code in a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
- Access to a Vercel account with appropriate permissions
- API endpoints and other backend services already deployed to AWS
- Environment variables documented and ready to configure

## Timeline

The Vercel deployment process is typically much faster than AWS setup and should take approximately 2-4 hours:

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Vercel Account Setup | 30 minutes |
| Project Configuration | 1 hour |
| Environment Variables | 30 minutes |
| Deployment | 30 minutes |
| Domain Configuration | 1 hour |

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Securely store sensitive information
2. **Build Settings**: Configure proper build and output settings
3. **Access Control**: Limit team access to production deployments
4. **Preview Deployments**: Use preview deployments for testing
