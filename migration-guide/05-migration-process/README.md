# Migration Process

## Overview

This section outlines the step-by-step process for migrating the KGC application from Replit to AWS. The migration will be performed in a systematic manner to ensure minimal disruption to users and preserve application functionality throughout the process.

2. [Database Migration](./02-database-migration.md)
3. [Frontend Deployment](./03-frontend-deployment.md)
4. [API Gateway Configuration](./04-api-gateway.md)
5. [Testing Procedures](./05-testing-procedures.md)

## Migration Principles

The migration process follows these core principles:

1. **Zero-Downtime**: Users should be able to access the application throughout the migration
2. **Data Integrity**: No data loss during the migration process
3. **Reversibility**: Ability to roll back at any stage if issues arise
4. **Incremental Changes**: Migration in small, manageable steps
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough validation at each migration stage

## Migration Phases

The migration will be conducted in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Preparation
- Complete immediate fixes outlined in Section 2
- Set up AWS infrastructure as outlined in Section 3
- Implement security features as outlined in Section 4
- Test each component in isolation

### Phase 2: Database Migration
- Snapshot existing PostgreSQL database
- Migrate schema to AWS RDS
- Validate data integrity
- Set up replication for continuous data synchronization

### Phase 3: Backend Deployment
- Deploy Node.js/Express backend to AWS
- Configure with AWS secrets and connections
- Point to new RDS database
- Implement API Gateway as a proxy

### Phase 4: Frontend Deployment
- Deploy React frontend to S3/CloudFront
- Update API endpoints to point to API Gateway
- Test full application functionality
- Validate user experience

### Phase 5: Cutover
- Redirect DNS to the new AWS environment
- Monitor application performance and errors
- Keep old environment running for fallback
- Complete cutover when stability is confirmed

## Migration Timeline

The complete migration process is expected to take 4-6 weeks:

- Preparation: 1-2 weeks
- Database Migration: 1 week
- Backend Deployment: 1 week
- Frontend Deployment: 1 week
- Cutover and Validation: 3-5 days

## Risk Mitigation

The migration plan includes these risk mitigation strategies:

1. **Regular Backups**: Frequent backups throughout the migration
2. **Parallel Environments**: Keep old and new environments running simultaneously
3. **Detailed Rollback Plans**: Documentation for reverting to the previous state
4. **Incremental Testing**: Validate each component before moving to the next
5. **User Communication**: Clear notifications about migration progress
