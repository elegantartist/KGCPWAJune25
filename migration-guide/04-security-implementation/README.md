# Security Implementation

## Overview

This section outlines the security implementation procedures for the KGC application in the AWS environment. The focus is on establishing robust authentication, authorization, encryption, and monitoring mechanisms that comply with APP and TGA regulations for healthcare data.

4. [Audit Logging and Monitoring](./04-audit-logging.md)
5. [Security Testing and Validation](./05-security-testing.md)

## Security Implementation Principles

The KGC application's security implementation follows these core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various threats
2. **Least Privilege**: Users and services have only the permissions they need
3. **Zero Trust**: All access requests must be authenticated and authorized
4. **Secure by Default**: Security controls are built-in, not added on
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time detection of potential security incidents

## Regulatory Compliance

The security implementation ensures compliance with:

- **Australian Privacy Principles (APP)**: Guidelines for handling personal information
- **Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)**: Requirements for medical device software
- **Good Data Security Practices**: Industry-standard security controls

## Implementation Timeline

The security implementation process should take approximately 2-3 weeks, including testing and validation. The work will be prioritized as follows:

1. Authentication and authorization systems
2. Data encryption (in transit and at rest)
3. Audit logging and monitoring
4. Security testing and validation

## Key Security Features

The KGC application's security implementation includes:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all admin and doctor accounts
2. **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Detailed permissions for different user roles
3. **End-to-End Encryption**: For all patient health data
4. **Comprehensive Audit Trails**: Logging of all data access and modifications
5. **Automated Security Alerts**: Real-time notifications for suspicious activities
