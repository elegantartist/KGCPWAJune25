5. [Compliance Documentation](./05-compliance-documentation.md)

## Operational Principles

Post-migration operations follow these core principles:

1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Identifying and addressing issues before they impact users
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly optimizing application performance and security
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Maintaining compliance with APP and TGA regulations
4. **Cost Optimization**: Balancing performance needs with cost efficiency
5. **Documentation**: Keeping technical and compliance documentation current

## Key Operational Tasks

### Daily Operations
- Review CloudWatch dashboards and alerts
- Analyze application logs for errors or security concerns
- Monitor database performance and resource utilization
- Process and respond to any user-reported issues

### Weekly Operations
- Review performance metrics and trends
- Run security scans and address any findings
- Test backup and recovery procedures
- Update documentation with any operational changes

### Monthly Operations
- Conduct comprehensive security reviews
- Evaluate AWS resource usage and optimize costs
- Apply non-critical updates and patches
- Review and update compliance documentation

### Quarterly Operations
- Conduct disaster recovery drills
- Review and update security policies

## On-Call Support Procedures

The KGC application requires 24/7 monitoring with structured on-call support:

1. **Alert Triage**: Process for evaluating and responding to automated alerts
2. **Escalation Path**: Clear procedure for escalating issues to appropriate personnel
3. **Incident Documentation**: Templates for documenting and reviewing incidents
4. **Communication Plan**: Procedures for notifying stakeholders during incidents

## Operational Documentation

Maintain these operational documents for the KGC application:

1. **Runbook**: Step-by-step procedures for common operational tasks
2. **Architecture Diagram**: Current application infrastructure documentation
3. **Incident Response Plan**: Procedures for handling various system incidents
4. **Contact List**: Key personnel responsible for different system components
