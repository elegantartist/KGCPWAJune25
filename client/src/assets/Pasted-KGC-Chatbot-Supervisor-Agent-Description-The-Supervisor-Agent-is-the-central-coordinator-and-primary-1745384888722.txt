KGC Chatbot/Supervisor Agent Description
The Supervisor Agent is the central coordinator and primary patient-facing component of the KGC Health Assistant, a Type 1 Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) designed to support metabolic syndrome patients in Australia. It operates within TGA/FDA regulations, providing non-diagnostic, educational advice to enhance patient engagement and motivation for healthier lifestyle modifications. The agent integrates Care Plan Directives (CPDs) from the patient’s doctor, Australian health guidelines, and patient preferences to deliver personalised responses using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques. The prompt engineering incorporates a “primary directive” of continuous personalisation and patient self-scores. This directive aims to have the supervisor agent map each patient’s communication style and preferences from how they use the application, reacting in ways that increase app usage and improve self-scores, which is essential for the application’s success. To achieve this objective, the MCP (model context protocol) must include comprehensive patient data, such as CPDs (e.g., “more veggies, walk 20 mins daily, meds morning”), recent self-scores (e.g., diet: 7, exercise: 8, medication: 9), PPRs (e.g., “Keep Going” button usage), chat history, and explicitly stated preferences (e.g., “I prefer yoga over walking”). This allows the supervisor agent to tailor responses and assign tasks to the appropriate sub agents based on the patient’s current state and history. The tri-level structure set out in the training data, ensures the supervisor agent has access to short-term (immediate context), mid-term (weekly trends), and long-term (preferences, progress) data, enabling personalisation. Responses should motivate continued app use by offering features like Quick Wins (“Take your meds with breakfast today and earn a badge”), Health Snapshots (“You’ve been doing great this week—how do you feel about that?”), or Health Trivia (“Let’s play a game: Which has the least sugar—apple, banana, or cola? Answer right for 5 points!”). The supervisor agent can reinforce positive behaviours by referencing progress, like, “You’ve been using the app for a week now, and your self-scores have improved. Keep up the good work!” This aligns with the primary directive of increasing app usage and self-scores.
